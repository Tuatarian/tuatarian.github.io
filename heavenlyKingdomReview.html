                <div style="padding: 0rem 3rem; line-height: 1.6;">
                    <p>I recently decided to, both for the sake of posterity and for the memorialization of my personal experience reading a particular book, write and post somewhat longer-form reviews of all/many/most history books that I complete. I will begin this endeavour with the book I have most recently finished, <i>Autumn in the Heavenly Kingdom</i> by Stephen R Platt. This book is about the Taiping rebellion, though it does tangentially touch upon a few other topics on the way. I was almost entirely unable to find information on this book prior to my reading it - very unusually for me, I was only able to perform fairly cursory veracity checks (publisher is Knopf, part of Penguin Random House, which is fine. Author is a professor of Chinese History at UC Irvine, a well known and presumably well reputed research university). I was largely unable to find anyone discussing this book, but decided to check it out and read it anyway, albeit with a somewhat skeptical eye</p>

                    <p style="padding-top: 3rem;">This book posessess a remarkable ability to simultaneously focus in on specific people, places, and events of interest while also not also losing view of the larger scope of the conflict. It opens, somewhat surprisingly, by discussing not the future Taiping Heavenly Emperor Hong Xiuquan, but his distant cousin, the "less bright" Hong Rengan. This may at first seem a strange choice (after all, Hong Xiuquan was the absolute head of the Heavenly Kingdom) but it, like many other seeming "diversions" of varying importance and magnitude, pays dividends. The understanding we gain of Hong Rengan and his interactions with and impressions upon the Westerners in China prove to be key to understanding the frustrating situation of Taiping foreign policy, but understanding Hong Xiuquan proves to be both much harder and much less useful. There are plenty of descisions like these (following the campaigns of the Opium War, giving only a quick summary of the revolt of the Eastern King against the Heavenly Emperor, the relatively large amount of background information given about Zeng Guofan, etc etc) which may seem almost off-topic at first, but always justify their inclusion sooner or later. Not only does this make the story fairly easy to follow, but also allows the reader plenty opportunity for analysis, and this "prep work" and time taken off from discussion of the goings of the main conflict pay off in spades</p>

                    <p style="padding-top: 3rem;">Regarding Bias, I felt the book to be largely fair. I would like to note that I am far from what can reasonably be considered an expert on this (or for that matter, any) subject, but the book seems to generally have a negative attitude towards the Qing, which seems reasonable, and also more mildly dislikes Manchu treatment of the ethnic Chinese, which also seemed pretty fair to me. The book places great emphasis on the role played by the French, and more significantly, the British, in causing the downfall of the Taiping, which also seems fair. I don't think it is true to say that the author takes a pro-Taiping view, however. I did not recieve the impression that Platt was holding back negative information about the Taiping, though he does strongly imply that the alleged destruction left in the wake of the Taiping was generally either a fabrication (mostly from British sources) or not beyond that expected during wartime, and points out (using concrete examples like the Qing capture of Anqing) that the atrocities commmited on the imperial side often exceeded those from the Taiping</p>

                    <p style="padding-top: 3rem;">All in all, I greatly enjoyed reading this book. Though I am no expert, I did not feel it to be too strongly biased in favour of one side or the other, and Platt maintains a masterful flow throughout the book that makes the story of the time period an easy one to follow. This book does not go too deep into the conflict, and omits a great number of largely irrelevant details. Perhaps a professional historian looking for a book on this time period may be well advised to skip this one, I can happily reccomend <I>Autumn in the Heavenly Kingdom</I> to the vast majority of people looking to determine if this book is worth their time.</p>
