	  <h2>Opinion 6: While some may complain about the lack of "real" opinions on this website, they are not present because I have not had them between the site's creation and now, and anyway they are not something to be forced. However, I should probably write more in each opinion that I post.</h2>
	</div>
	<p>
	  However, I will not choose this opinion to begin writing more. Perhaps the next.

	  <h2>Opinion 5: It is better to be a nice person than to be a mean person, for various reasons</h2>
	</div>
	<p>
	  Intriguingly, this is not a fact, but a true opinion. The notion that opinions can also be facts is first referenced in <a href="#op1">Opinion 1</a> and demonstrated in <a href="#op2">Opinion 2</a>
	</p>

	  <h2>Opinion 4: It is acceptable but not preferable to host an opinion page that is not linked to on the landing page of one's website</h2>
	</div>
	<p>
	  While by <a href="#op1">Opinion 1</a> it is worthwhile to compile such a page of opinions, it is also preferable to display them in a location where they can be found by others, such that they can discover the opinions that you have held. However, if one is uncomfortable doing this, the option of creating an opinions page that is not linked to from one's main site, but can be accessed by those who are aware of its existence is preferable to the option of not creating one at all.

	  <h2>Opinion 3: While it would have been fantastic if I had started this website earlier, the best time to start between now and the end of time is now</h2>
	</div>
	<p>
	  This is an example of an opinion which is not a fact, but truly an opinion. This is an extension of <a href="#op1">Opinion 1: It is annoying but worthwhile to list every opinion one has ever had on a website similar to this one</a>

	  <h2>Opinion 2: California is the greatest State</h2>
	</div>
	<p>
	  Please note that I do not discriminate between different definitons of state, nor do I specify a nation in which the state should be located. This claim is highly general. As observed in <a href="#op1">Opinion 1</a>, this is a fact, despite being labelled as an opinion.

	<div id="op1">
	  <h2>Opinion 1: It is annoying but worthwhile to list every opinion one has ever had on a website similar to this one</h2>
	</div>
	<p>
	  This opinion website would not exist without the great <a href="https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/OPINIONS.html">opinion website</a> of Doron Zeilberger. I will only sometimes be providing justifications for my opinions. I will also be occasionally stating facts and not opinions, though I may label them as opinions anyway (for an example, see <a href="#op2">Opinion 2: California is the greatest State</a>).
